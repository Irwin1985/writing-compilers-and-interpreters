# Writing Compilers And Interpreters

This project is an attempt to work through [Ronald Mak](http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~mak/)'s book, ["Writing Compilers and Interpreters" (3rd ed., 2009)](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Writing+Compilers+and+Interpreters%3A+A+Software+Engineering+Approach%2C+3rd+Edition-p-9780470177075), using the Go programming language.

Like the book's original content, this is writen to compile and interpret the Pascal programming language.  Or, more pointedly, to learn the mechanics behind compiling and interpreting a programming language.

Certain changes have been made, which should not have any impact on the content of the work.  In particular, Steve Francia's [cobra package](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) is used to handle command line parsing.
